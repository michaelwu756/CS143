We implemented a website to query the database by separating the backend and
front end sections. The all the SQL code is in functions.php, and the remaining
.php files implement the webpages. We made sure to escape all inputs to SQL
queries so that they do not mess up on special characters. We used bootstrap for
styling and theming the webpage.

The subsections of our webpage include four add pages for actors, directors,
movies, and comments. We also have two add pages to connect actors to movies and
to connect directors to movies. We have two browse pages where the user can
select from a list of all the actors and movies to browse. When viewing a
particular actor, the user can view all the actor information as well as the
movies that the actor has been in. When viewing a particular movie, the user can
see all the movie information, the actors in the movie, the average rating of
the movie, as well as any comments on the movie. There is a link to add a
comment to the movie. Lastly there is a search bar, which searches both the
actor and movie database for matches.

Our responsibilities for this project were split as follows.

Jennie: Wrote most of the front end code and set up the css and javascript,
        overall design of website layout.

Michael: Wrote the SQL queries in functions.php, backend management, testing,
         video recording, and managing the final submission.

The division of the frontend/backend sections made for a natural work style that
made the project easier, as we could separate what we were doing. We met up and
managed to finish by spending the whole day working on the project.
